## 📌 Introduction 
Hi there! I’m a Operations Analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights that improve patient care, operational efficiency, and organizational outcomes. With hands-on experience in data analytics, process improvement, and stakeholder collaboration across healthcare and benefits administration environments, I specialize in turning real-world problems into data-driven solutions.

This portfolio showcases end-to-end analytics and optimization projects in the healthcare data and systems domain.

It integrates technical expertise (SQL, Tableau, Power BI, AI-powered analytics) with healthcare domain knowledge (EMR/EHR workflows, compliance, and process improvement).

Each project demonstrates how data can drive operational excellence, enhance care delivery, and support informed decision-making across healthcare organizations.

### 1️⃣ "Emergency Department Operations Analysis: Identifying Drivers of Wait Time and Patient Walkouts"

** 📘Project Overview:** This project focuses on improving emergency department operational performance through advanced analytics and dashboarding.
Using SQL Server and Power BI, the analysis identifies peak congestion times, staffing bottlenecks, and walkout trends to drive faster patient throughput and resource allocation.

**🩺 Business Problem:** Emergency Departments (EDs) face significant challenges balancing patient volume, acuity, and staffing constraints.
Common issues include:
- Long patient wait times during peak hours
- Inconsistent staff coverage across shifts
- Rising walkout (LWBS) rates due to excessive delays
- Lack of real-time visibility into performance metrics
  
These factors directly affect patient outcomes, satisfaction, and regulatory compliance.

**💡 Solution:**
A set of data models, SQL queries, and Power BI dashboards were created to identify operational inefficiencies and enable continuous performance monitoring.
Key Actions:
Built SQL models calculating average wait times, walkout rates, and staffing correlations.
Created shift-level KPIs for throughput, workload, and patient flow performance.
Developed a Power BI dashboard displaying:
Wait time by triage level
Staffing-to-demand correlation
Peak arrival time heatmaps
Walkout rate trends
Implemented “Critical Delay Detection” logic to flag high-acuity patients waiting beyond safe thresholds.

**Impact:**
↓ Average wait times by 18%
↓ Walkout rates by 22%
↑ Data-driven staffing and scheduling decisions
